<h1> Fake CMD for scambaiting </h1>
<p>
Just for fun I wrote a simple (fake) CMD that can be used for scambaiting, it uses actual <code>cmd.exe</code> to run commands so every command is working. There's a lot of fake cmd's but this is my try.

As I said this acts like a normal cmd, but there's joke hotkeys:
</p>
<p>
(F keys)
</p>
<ul>
    <li> F1: Every time scammer presses a key, the window is unfocused, needing him to focus again to type another key </li>
    <li> F2: Every time scammer presses a key, the color of CMD foreground and background changes </li>
    <li> F3: Doesn't allow to write more than 3 digits in one line </li>
    <li> F4: The window will always be on top </li>
    <li> F5: Substitute words (hardcoded) 
        <ul> 
            <li> Foreign: Trusted </li>
            <li> ESTABLISHED: SECURE </li>
            <li> Refund: Airplane </li>
            <li> refund: airplane </li>
            <li> REFUND: AIRPLANE </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> F6: the window slowly scrolls up </li>
</ul>
